### AirBnB_clone
A complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.
## Description

It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone. 

This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.
The console is a Unix shell-like command line user interface provided by the python CmdModule It prints a prompt and waits for the user for input, for our project we used (hbnb)


Display command - help	(hbnb) help <command>
Create object (prints its id)	- (hbnb) create <class>
Destroy object - (hbnb) destroy <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)
Show object	- (hbnb) show <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)
Show "all" objects or instances class	- (hbnb) all or (hbnb) all <class>
Run console -	./console.py
Quit console - (hbnb) quit
